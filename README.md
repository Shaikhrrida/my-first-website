My First Frontend Website (practice project)

This is my very first frontend project — a simple, static, and non-responsive website built using only HTML5 and CSS3. It helped me understand the fundamentals of web structure, layout, and basic styling.

Live Website:
https://shaikhrrida.github.io/my-first-website/

Project Summary:

Created the structure using semantic HTML5 elements

Designed layout and styling using pure CSS3

Focused on understanding clean and well-organized code

Hosted using GitHub Pages for practice in deployment

Note: This website is not responsive and is designed for desktop view only. It was built as a learning project to grasp the core concepts of HTML and CSS before moving on to more advanced topics like responsiveness and interactivity.

GitHub Pages

Project Structure:
index.html — Main web page
